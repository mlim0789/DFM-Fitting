# DFM-Fitting

This repository contains code for diffusion flux model (DFM) fitting of particle tumor accumulation, using available pharmacokinetics (PK) data.

The fit will output particle effective permeability (P_eff), useful for comparing transport of various nanoparticles across multiple tumor models.
