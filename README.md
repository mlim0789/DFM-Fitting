# DFM-Fitting

This repository contains code for diffusion flux model (DFM) fitting of particle tumor accumulation, using available pharmacokinetics (PK) data. The fit will output particle effective permeability (P_eff), useful for comparing transport of various nanoparticles across multiple tumor models.

Code is available as Python file (.py), or Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb). To run the analysis, download template Excel files for storing PK and tumor accumulation data, and modify the filepaths accordily on the Python code.

More details on the mathematical model and sample analysis can be found on:
